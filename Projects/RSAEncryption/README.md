**SUMMARY**
  - The purpose of this project will be to implement an algorithm that takes a file and encrypts it using RSA Encryption.
  - The encryption process begins with compressing the file using Huffman Compression so that we have a binary representation of the entire file text that we can perform mathematical operations on. This number will then be hashed to an extremely large number which will then be modded by a public key and that resulting value will then be written to the file along with the public key.
  - For decryption, one must know the private key that will be used in a formula that takes the file text number and transforms it back into its Huffman binary representation. Finally, that binary number will run through the Huffman expansion algorithm and will be transformed back into the file's original text.
