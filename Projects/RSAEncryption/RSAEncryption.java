 *  SUMMARY: Class that reads in a file and encrypts or decrypts using
 *           the popular and effective RSA encryption algorithm that takes
 *           advantage of keys and modular arithmitic. If public keys are known,
 *           one can encypt their message and send it for decyption. The only
 *           way to decrypt is to know the private key which is the modulas
 *           of an insanely large number that would take years for a computer
 *           to crack without the private key.
